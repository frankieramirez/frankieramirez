        I'm a frontend architect with over a decade of experience building scalable web applications and design systems. I specialize in bridging the gap between design intent and engineering execution — turning complex UI requirements into performant, maintainable component architectures.

        My approach centers on system-level thinking: building the right abstractions, establishing clear patterns, and creating tools that empower teams to ship faster without sacrificing quality. I believe the best interfaces are built at the intersection of design precision and engineering rigor.
