        I build <span class="font-pixel text-foreground">frontend architectures</span> — the kind of scalable, component-driven systems that let teams ship fast without accumulating debt. React, Next.js, Astro, TypeScript — the framework matters less than the abstractions underneath it.

        I think a lot about the space between design and engineering. <span class="font-pixel text-foreground">Design systems</span>, tokens, motion, layout — the craft of translating a designer's intent into production UI that feels exactly right.

        On the platform side, I care about <span class="font-pixel text-foreground">developer experience</span> — build tooling, CI/CD pipelines, and the infrastructure that makes a team's daily work feel effortless. Good DX compounds over time.
